# sign_language_recogniser
Developed a real-time gesture recognition system by leveraging Python libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Matplotlib for computer vision and ML tasks, trained on a large dataset of hand keypoints. 
Achieved an accurate hand gesture classification through implementation of LSTM  neural network
